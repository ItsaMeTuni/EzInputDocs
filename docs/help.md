## EzInput is not detecting my controller profile

Make sure you added the controller profile to the "controller profiles" list in EzInput's prefab. You can find the prefab at `EzInput/Resources`.

## How do I change the bindings, controller profiles or default controller profile at runtime?

Take a look at [this](code-reference/#changing-bindings-controller-profiles-or-default-controller-profile-at-runtime).
