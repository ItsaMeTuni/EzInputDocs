# The EzInput prefab

When the game starts (in the editor or in a build) an EzInput Game Object is created and that's where the logic runs. It's prefab can be found at `EzInput/Resources` and there you can change the Bindings file EzInput will use, you can change all Controller Configs (there's an array there) and the default Controller Config.
