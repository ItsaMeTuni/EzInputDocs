#The test scene

The test scene is a scene that comes with EzInput that you can use to help in the process of configuring your controller profiles. It has the layout of a PS4 controller (isn't much different from the XBox controller layout, the only thing different is that the Left stick and D-Pad have swapped positions). When you press a button, a trigger or move a stick you will see the changes in the screen. This allows you to track down wrongly set up buttons and axes in your controller and fix them.  

You can select which controller you want to test on the top right corner of the screen, there's a list with all connected controllers there.

!!! hint
    sometimes the list might not update when connecting/disconnecting a controller so you might need to click "Refresh list".

On the top left corner of the screen you can find a list of all of your keybindings along with their current values.
